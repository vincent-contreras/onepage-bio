			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Finance solutions, securities and trading</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning. I'm working through several online classes, and swap articles with collegues.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>RC Planes and Boats</b>. I've been an enthusiastic hobbiest since I was a teenager - but only as an adult am I able to afford the higher-quality
          devices. I like to modify existing kits to improve speed, and add instrumentation.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Swimming</b>. I previously lived in the Philppine archipelagos, where we are mostly surrounded by water. It only takes 30 minutes to reach a nearby beach from my hometown. I enjoy my weekends doing swimming and I hope to participate in a swimming competition one day here in Seoul.
